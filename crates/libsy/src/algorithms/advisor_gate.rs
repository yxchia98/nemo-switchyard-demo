//! Executor gated by a once-per-session advisor review.
//!
//! The executor answers every client-visible turn. Turns with tool calls pass
//! through unreviewed; the first *terminal* turn — no tool calls (or a text
//! match under the `pattern` trigger) — is buffered and shown to a stronger
//! advisor model together with the full transcript. `APPROVE` releases the
//! buffered turn unchanged; `REDO` appends the discarded turn's text and the
//! advisor's plan as feedback, then re-invokes the executor so it keeps
//! working. Each budget scope (one benchmark evaluation, one session, or the
//! whole instance — see [`budget::budget_scope`]) is reviewed at most
//! `max_reviews` times; afterwards every call is a pure passthrough.
//!
//! This design is a near-superset of solo executor behavior: identical until
//! the executor first claims to be done, plus one quality gate that catches
//! premature convergence. Front-loading advice was measured to suppress the
//! executor's own test-and-iterate loop, so no advice is injected up front.
//!
//! Failure posture: executor errors always propagate (including
//! `ContextWindowExceeded`, which hosts map to a client-visible 400 so agent
//! harnesses can compact). Advisor errors honor `fail_open` — the buffered
//! turn passes through as an implicit APPROVE — refund the consumed review,
//! and count toward a per-scope failure cap that stops consulting a down
//! advisor entirely.
//!
//! Structure: [`AdvisorGate`] is a thin orchestrator — the [`signals`]
//! processor folds each event's facts into per-turn state, the [`trigger`]
//! classifier reads them after the executor call, and the [`budget`] ledger
//! holds the only mutable state.
