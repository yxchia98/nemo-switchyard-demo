//! Stage-router scoring and tier selection — the shared routing core.
//!
//! Given [`ToolSignals`] extracted from a normalized request, this module decides
//! whether a coding-agent turn should go to the **capable** or **efficient** tier.
//! [`StageClassifier`] applies that decision inside [`crate::StageRouter`].
//!
//! Two axes:
//!
//! * **error** — did the recent tool results error? (`severity`)
//! * **production** — is the agent producing code? (`spinning` / `exploring`
//!   push toward capable; `production_intensity` pushes toward efficient)
//!
//! Signals are scored with fixed weights, summed, and `tanh`-squashed into
//! `(-1, +1)`; `confidence` is the magnitude. The `confidence_threshold` dials
//! how much corroboration a decisive escalation needs (see [`score_signal`]).
