//! HTTP LLM client that speaks Switchyard's neutral IR directly.
//!
//! [`TranslatingLlmClient`] maps a model name (and the wire format resolved from
//! the request) to a [`Backend`],
//! encodes a [`switchyard_protocol::Request`] to that backend's wire format via
//! `switchyard-translation`, applies auth and forwards caller headers, makes the
//! HTTP call with a shared [`reqwest::Client`], and decodes the wire response
//! back to a [`switchyard_protocol::Response`] — supporting both buffered and
//! streamed responses.
//!
//! [`run()`] pairs the client with a libsy algorithm: it drives
//! [`switchyard_libsy::Algorithm::run_stream`], serves routing-time calls, and makes the terminal
//! answer call from the routing outcome when needed. A host that just wants the answer does not
//! have to drive the step stream itself.
