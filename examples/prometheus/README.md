# Prometheus + Alertmanager deployable artifacts

Drop-in Prometheus configuration for a Switchyard deployment. Pair with
[`docs/internal/metrics_reference.md`](../../docs/internal/metrics_reference.md) for the
full metric inventory and label semantics.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `prometheus.yml` | A single `scrape_configs:` entry to merge into your existing Prometheus config. Targets Switchyard's `/metrics`. |
| `switchyard.rules.yaml` | Alert rule group implementing the operational and success-criterion alerts. Validates with `promtool check rules`. |

A Grafana dashboard is intentionally not included — dashboard authoring
belongs to whichever team owns observability conventions in your
deployment. The metric catalog in `docs/internal/metrics_reference.md` is the
input.

## Wire-up

### 1. Add the scrape job

Merge the `scrape_configs:` entry from `prometheus.yml` into your
Prometheus configuration (adjust the `targets:` list to point at your
Switchyard pods or hosts). The endpoint is plain `GET /metrics` over
HTTP, no auth.

If you're running Switchyard on Kubernetes, the example scrape job uses
static targets; a `kubernetes_sd_configs` variant is a one-step swap for
cluster-native discovery.

### 2. Load the alert rules

```bash
cp switchyard.rules.yaml /etc/prometheus/rules/
promtool check rules /etc/prometheus/rules/switchyard.rules.yaml
```

Then reference the file in your Prometheus config's `rule_files:`
section and reload:

```yaml
rule_files:
  - /etc/prometheus/rules/switchyard.rules.yaml
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://<prometheus>:9090/-/reload
```

### 3. Validate

Once Prometheus has scraped a few cycles, sanity-check the active
series:

```promql
{__name__=~"switchyard_.*"}
```

You should see the families documented in `metrics_reference.md` —
top-line gauges, per-endpoint counters and histograms, and outcome counters.

## Alert tuning notes

Default thresholds and `for:` windows in `switchyard.rules.yaml` are
conservative — tuned to avoid pages during routine scrape-config rolls
or single-poll blips. Review them against your SLOs before enabling
notifications:

* `RouterOverheadHigh` is set at the success-criterion threshold (p99 >
  1 ms for 5 m). Check its `algorithm` label and `/v1/stats` classifier
  traffic before treating it as a routing-decision regression.
